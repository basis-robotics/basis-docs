TODO. This is a scary one. To gain acceptance, as many companies as possible need to use the framework. To that end, for academic and personal use, it should always be free. For companies, I lean towards something like the model Unreal Engine uses with licensing. Maybe free up to some amount of revenue. The first goal is to be self sustaining somehow so that this doesn't die before it can be used. It will probably look like taking some VC money and figuring out how to monetize from there. I think there's a market - a bit of investment up front to save the pain of switching away from ROS or making large architectural changes later would be worth it. I've been on the other side of this.

I've seen open source go great (Sentry for example - great product, great value) and not so great (I'm still a big believer in Foxglove - I understand why they close sourced Foxglove Studio - I'd love to see them successful enough to open it back up someday).

If you're an investor that wants to fund this, or a company looking to contract work for something like this, let me know.

Even if this all goes belly up, I spent some time getting the ideas I had out of my head and into source control.
