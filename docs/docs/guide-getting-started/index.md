# Getting Started
 
This tutorial will walk you through creating a basis project from scratch and writing code with basis.

Please see [basis-examples/simple_pub_sub](https://github.com/basis-robotics/basis-examples/tree/main/cpp/simple_pub_sub) for the end result of the tutorial, and [basis_test_robot](https://github.com/basis-robotics/basis_test_robot) for a more complex "real world" example.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

import { useDocsSidebar } from '@docusaurus/theme-common/internal';

<DocCardList />
```
